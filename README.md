# Minor-Project:

      So, in this Python For Data Sience "Minor-Project" we did the prediction of the stock price for future.
   
      Our Data Science Project Topic is "Visualising and forecasting stocks" 
   
      Here we do the analyse of the previous Days stocks prices and form the study of that data we predict the future days stocks prices and ploting the Graph.
   
   To Visualising and forecasting stock we did the some Steps for it.
   
   Step 1: We collect the stock data from the dataset of the file.
           
           Here we uesed the Apple Company's stock data from "2021-Nov." to "2022-Nov."
           Read the file and Import the Libraries thoes  What we need for our project to prefome.
           
   Step 2: Preprocess the Data - Train and Test 
            
            In this Step we Load the data and Visualize the data from dataset.
            First of all we check the data in file If it's any Null Values contenting or not.
            And Clean the Data First 
            
   Step 3: Create an stocked LSTM Model:
   
            The Long Short-Term Memory (short: LSTM) model is a subtype of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
            It is used to recognize patterns in data sequences, such as those that appear in sensor data, stock prices, or natural language. 
            RNNs are able to do this because, in addition to the actual value, they also include its position in the sequence in the prediction.
   
   Step 4: Predict the test data and plot the output:
              
             Read and Studying the test data and ploting the Graph of the current stock price  
   
   Step 5: Predict the future of 30 days and ploting the output:
   
            To the Predicting the future we did the read and study the previous 100 days stcok price and data
            and we analysis the that period and got the 30 average Values from it and that's the our predicted future
            
            So we analysis the 100 Days Data And Predict the futures Next 30 Days Stock Price.
